This directory is only the tracing folder to the chrome source.
Tracing is a subsection or resources.
To run, you will also need at least the full resources directory.

To work on this code:
  cd src/chrome/browser/resources/
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

In any browser, navigate to
  http://localhost:8000/tracing/tests.html

If you add a file, make sure to update:
 ../tracing.js
And, of course, verify all the tests,
